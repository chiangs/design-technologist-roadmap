# Career roadmap for Design Technologists & UX Engineers in 2022

// Intro and vision here

## Contributing

Typos, grammatical, or minor visual corrections can be suggested via [Issues](https://github.com/chiangs/design-technologist-roadmap/issues)

The DT/UXE path is still quite new and ambiguous. If you have suggestions on the content itself please open a [Discussion](https://github.com/chiangs/design-technologist-roadmap/discussions)

## Branch strategy

`main` is the releasse version for the current year and previous years will be branched for archiving purposes.

When working on a change, create your own branch and create a pull request to `main`.
