<!-- Intro and vision here -->

This project aims to start the discussion and development of a framework for career progression for Design Technologists (DT). DTs are a relatively new role found in agencies and in-house teams. What comes next? Lead DT, surely. But what about further down the line? Let's find out! 🚀 

## ⤴️ Branch strategy

`main` is the releasse version for the current year and previous years will be branched for archiving purposes.

When working on a change, create your own branch and create a pull request to `main`.

## 📄 Updating the README

The table of contents is built with a VS Code extension called `Markdown All in One` using the command to create a table of contents. If your editor has the extension, the ToC will auto-update on save. 

## ➕ Contributing

Typos, grammatical, or minor visual corrections can be suggested via [Issues](https://github.com/chiangs/design-technologist-roadmap/issues).

The DT/UXE path is still quite new and ambiguous. If you have suggestions on the content itself please open a [Discussion](https://github.com/chiangs/design-technologist-roadmap/discussions).

To get yourself added to the contributors list, just do any of the following:

- Your pull request has to be merged
- A bot will automatically add you as contributor after a successful merge
- Contribute to the development of the roadmap in discussions
- Raise an issue. Thanks!

Approver of the PR / Issues / Discussion will use the `@all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>` command.
